In Egg Invaders, the player controls a bird that appears at the bottom of the screen.  The player can move the bird right and left using the arrow keys and shoot bullets using the spacebar.

When the game begins, a fleet of eggs fills the sky and moves across and down the screen.  The player shoots and destroys the eggs.  If the player shoots all the eggs, a new fleet appear appears that moves faster than the previous fleet.  

If any egg hits the player's bird or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player loses a ship.  If the player loses three ships, the game ends.
